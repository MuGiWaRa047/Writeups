### Desccription :
I was on an in-state skiing trip with my family when we decided to go out and see some sights. I remember needing to go to the bathroom near where these pictures were taken and then leaving a review. Can you find this review for me?

## Solution

This challenge was very simple, just look at discription closely, `needing to go to the bathroom near where these pictures were taken` means he need to go to the bathroom ðŸ¤£ near by where these pictures belonges to.

just search that pictures in google and you will find that this pictures are from Hot Creek Geological Site CA. and also link of reddit `https://www.reddit.com/r/whereisthis/comments/1bx7tbx/finding_location_from_2_photos/`

it that link :
   [Here](https://www.google.nl/maps/@37.6612707,-118.8285676,3a,75y,314.7h,92.09t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOW5MQOM1gYF7jRAEqVRca7ZAcF3IkWzUlYozFg!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOW5MQOM1gYF7jRAEqVRca7ZAcF3IkWzUlYozFg%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya265.0936-ro-0-fo100!7i11264!8i5632?entry=ttu) it is, Hot Creek Geological Site, Mammoth Lakes, CA.
   You can clearly see the matching gray 'path with a tree on either side in the second image.
   If you look to the left in the streetview, you can also see the large 'egg-shaped' rock seen in the left side of the first image.

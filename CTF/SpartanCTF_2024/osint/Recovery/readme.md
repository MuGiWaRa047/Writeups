# Recovery


### Description :

Look. I forgot the password to my account for the email server. Can you help me figure it out? I do, in fact, have a hashed version of the password (not that you'd be able to do anything with it):

07fc8e7f9f675b4281b1ac40ca187eb5da698024cb6bf893be62a96da33cfad5

Note: submit flag in format spartanCTF{PASSWORD}


## Solution

think about website that we can use to check if the hash is stored and have plain text password, its crackstation and many more that we can use.

to solved this challenge simply use [crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/) , ans search for given hash you will get your password it's `bigdork!` 
 
   submit flag in format spartanCTF{PASSWORD}

#### flag :   spartanCTF{bigdork!}
